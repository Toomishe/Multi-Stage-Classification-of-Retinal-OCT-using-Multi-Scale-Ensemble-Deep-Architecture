ABSTRACT = {Accurate noninvasive diagnosis of retinal disorders is required for appropriate treatment or precision medicine. This work proposes a multi-stage classification network built on a multi-scale (pyramidal) feature ensemble architecture for retinal image classification using optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. First, a scale-adaptive neural network is developed to produce multi-scale inputs for feature extraction and ensemble learning. The larger input sizes yield more global information, while the smaller input sizes focus on local details. Then, a feature-rich pyramidal architecture is designed to extract multi-scale features as inputs using DenseNet as the backbone. The advantage of the hierarchical structure is that it allows the system to extract multi-scale, information-rich features for the accurate classification of retinal disorders. Evaluation on two public OCT datasets containing normal and abnormal retinas (e.g., diabetic macular edema (DME), choroidal neovascularization (CNV), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and Drusen) and comparison against recent networks demonstrates the advantages of the proposed architectureâ€™s ability to produce feature-rich classification with average accuracy of 97.78%, 96.83%, and 94.26% for the first (binary) stage, second (three-class) stage, and all-at-once (four-class) classification, respectively, using cross-validation experiments using the first dataset. In the second dataset, our system showed an overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.69%, 99.71%, and 99.87%, respectively. Overall, the tangible advantages of the proposed network for enhanced feature learning might be used in various medical image classification tasks where scale-invariant features are crucial for precise diagnosis.},
